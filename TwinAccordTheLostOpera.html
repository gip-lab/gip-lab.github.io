   <p>Twin Accord: Lost Opera is a stylised couch co-op action platformer based around Chinese folklore. 
     The story involves two siblings exploring a fantastical Chinese theatre, learning to resolve their differences and they find their way out of this otherworldly theatre.
  <p>This is the project that I am currently working on with my third year team at university. I am one of three programmers,
  my focus being on the player characters themselves in both movement and combat. The github is inaccessable due to it being on
  the internal university domain. There is, however, a public itch.io to access.</p>
