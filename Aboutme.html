   <h1>About me</h1>
   <p> I am an aspiring games developer currently studying Computing for games at Falmouth University. 
     I have completed a Level 3 Games Development course with D*D*D*, and I hope to work as a gameplay programmer or a similar field. </p> 
     <p>I have experience programming in python and C#. I have experience working with C++, with or without a game engine. I worked extensively with Unreal engine 5, unity, RPG maker MV and ren'py.​
     I have been working with python for roughly 8 years. I have worked with RPG maker MV for over 5 years and 
     I have over 5 years of experience with unity and nearly 2 years with unreal engine 5. I have released a full length game, Aerial Outcast, on itch.io. It was made in a software called RPG maker MV and began development in 2018, 
     when I was 13. This was a long term project of mine until August 2022 when it was finally released on itch.io. On my Btec, I developed a game prototype, Fairy Hunter, a short platformer called Gromos. and a group project for a game called Sandy: The royal escape, 
     where I acted as the programmer, level designer and UI designer. </p><p>My final year college project was a game called Cayenne's cafe, a stardew valley 
     inspired cafe simulator. All of these are accessible on the games page. I spent some of my summer holiday in 2022 volunteering at an NHS covid centre. During this time I learned 
     how to work as a team and how to communicate with patients. I spent time inside and outside of the Covid centre and worked with directing traffic, greeting people at the door, 
     directing people inside the building and cleaning. I also have experience with retail, having worked at Smiggle before starting university, and then Clarks for 2 summers in a row during university.
     I also work as a student ambassador at my university, helping run open days and doing tours of the campus. It requires me to work well in a team and with customers.
