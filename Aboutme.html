   <h1>About me</h1>
   <p> I am an aspiring games developer currently studying Computing for games at Falmouth University. 
     I have completed a Level 3 Games Development course with D*D*D*, and I plan to work as a gameplay programmer. 
     I now have experience programming in C# and python. I also have skills in drawing and 3D modelling. </p> 
     <p></p>I have experience programming in python and C#. I work with unity, RPG maker MV and ren'py. I am starting to learn Unreal and C++.​
     I have been working with python for roughly 8 years. I have worked with RPG maker MV for over 5 years and 
     I have over a year's experience in unity. I have released a full length game, Aerial Outcast, on itch.io. It was made in a software called RPG maker MV and began development in 2018, 
     when I was 13. This was a long term project of mine until August 2022 when it was finally released on itch.io. On my Btec, I developed a game prototype, Fairy Hunter, a short platformer called Gromos. and a group project for a game called Sandy: The royal escape, 
     where I acted as the programmer, level designer and UI designer. </p><p>My final year college project was a game called Cayenne's cafe, a stardew valley 
     inspired cafe simulator. All of these are accessible on the games page. I spent some of my summer holiday volunteering at an NHS covid centre, a total of 58 hours. During this time I learned 
     how to work as a team and how to communicate with patients. I spent time inside and outside of the Covid centre and worked with directing traffic, greeting people at the door, directing people inside the building and cleaning. I am also currently working on a zero hour contract at Smiggle as a shop assistant.
