   <p>Cayenne has always wanted to start a café. After many years of saving and some support 
     from her generous parents, she managed to buy her very own café in a small, countryside town. 
     Will she be able to balance making friends in this new town with running her business? 
     Will she adjust to this new environment? Will you help her make a café that will last?
     
After buying a building to set up in, she is left with a decent £1000 to get her café started. 
     Her parents have given her all they will and she’s on her own now. Or is she? 
     The friendly new town has plenty of people to help you, you just have to know where to look.</p>
   <p>This is a cafe management sims with social sim elements, I created this as my final year project for my level 3 games Btec.</p>
