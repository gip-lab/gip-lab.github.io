   <h1>Carnation Girls (demo)</h1>
   <img src="Assets/Portfolio/Carnation girls Mona thumbnail.png">
   <p>You're a detective who has been hired to solve the murder of the young heiress of the wealthy Carnation family. 
Of course, your job is inhibited by your fear of blood. But that's what Alvie is for. You are here to talk to the suspects and gain context, she will investigate the body.
You spend your days talking to the people of the household, often with the main three suspects, the deceased heiress's younger sisters: Mara, Marsha and May.
Will you manage to stay detached and professional? Or will you allow yourself to get attached and befriend the people you are meant to be investigating?
