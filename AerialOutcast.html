   <h1>Aerial Outcast</h1>
   <p>A retro-style RPG made in RPG maker MV. It is released and up for download on my itch.io page under Orchida.
You travel through the land of Oloinia, going through four different nations to save your sibling. Your sibling 
     ( Haiden or Hailey ) has been taken away by a mysterious woman and you have got to save them. 
     You play as either Hailey or Haiden, on a quest to save the other twin.
It contains turn-based combat, 100s of unique bust images and a unique pixel sprite for each NPC and playable character. 
     This has been a passion project for many years and I'm so happy that it's finally finished.
     
   <p>I have a youtube channel under Orchida studios where I have posted a trailer, gameplay footage with both a long and short playthrough..</p>
