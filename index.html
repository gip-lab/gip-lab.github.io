   <h2 id="Aboutme">About me</h2>
   <p> I am an aspiring games programmer currently studying computing for games at Falmouth university. 
     I have completed a level 3 games course in game development with a grade of D*D*D*. 
     I have released a full length game, Aerial outcast, on itch.io. It was made in a software 
     called RPG maker MV and began development in 2018, when I was 13. This was a long term 
     project of mine until August 2022 when it was finally released on itch.io. 
     On my Btec, I developed a game prototype, Fairy Hunter, a short platformer called Gromos. 
     and a group project for a game called Sandy: the royal escape, where I acted as the programmer, 
     level designer and UI designer. My final year college project, Cayenne's cafe, was a stardew valley 
     inspired cafe simulator. </p>
