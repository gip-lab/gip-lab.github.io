   <h2>Gameplay programmer and game designer</h2>

   <h2 id="Aboutme">About me</h2>
   <p> I am an aspiring games programmer currently studying computing for games at Falmouth university. 
     I have completed a level 3 games course in game development with a grade of D*D*D*. 
     I have released a full length game, Aerial outcast, on itch.io. It was made in a software 
     called RPG maker MV and began development in 2018, when I was 13. This was a long term 
     project of mine until August 2022 when it was finally released on itch.io. <br>
     On my Btec, I developed a game prototype, Fairy Hunter, a short platformer called Gromos. 
     and a group project for a game called Sandy: the royal escape, where I acted as the programmer, 
     level designer and UI designer. My final year college project, Cayenne's cafe, was a stardew valley 
     inspired cafe simulator.<br>
   My degree has an emphasis on groupwork and both of my listed university projects on the games page are group games.
   Rites Of Ragna was made over the course of the second year, and Twin Accord: The Lost Opera is still in progress but will
   continue until the end of the university year.<br>
     I have also done a variety of computing projects, most of which were practice worksheets. I would like to highlight my comp305_planets
     project, which I created with OpenGL and C++ as seen below.
