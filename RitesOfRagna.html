   <h1>Rites Of Ragna</h1>
   <p>Rites of  Ragna is a contemporary Norse turn-based RPG. 
     Play as Ragna, the living incarnation of Ragnarok, as she hunts down the snow-goddess Skahdi to free Loki from captivity.
     You will utilise mythical tools and ancient runes to conduct forbidden rituals in the midst of combat. 
     All to execute powerful effects, though they always come with a cost...
     
   <p>This is a turn-based RPG I made with my second-year team at university. It is based off of Norse mythology.</p>
